            <h1>About</h1>

            <h3>Mission</h3>
            <p class="indent">To support young athletes living in Chicago's northside neighborhoods, who have an
                interest in learning and playing soccer, with opportunities to learn and practice skills related to the
                game of soccer, specifically those skills around team cooperation and good sportsmanship.</p>
            <h3>Vision</h3>
            <p class="indent">The Northside Youth Soccer League aspires to develop strong, well-rounded, and mindful
                athletes through the building of character, self-discipline, and leadership.</p>
            <h3>General Information</h3>
            <p class="indent">The Northside Youth Soccer League was established in 1996 to provide athletes residing in
                Chicago's northside neighborhoods an environment in which to learn and play soccer. To be a member of
                NYSL, you must be between the ages of 4 - 12 and reside in a Chicago northside neighborhood. NYSL is run
                by a small full-time staff, and relies on the generous volunteer time of parents and previous league
                members.</p>
